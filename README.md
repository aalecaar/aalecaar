## Welcome!
Hi there ðŸ‘‹! Here you'll find an overview of some of the things I've done. Hope you find something interesting!

## My Apps
This is a compilation of the things I've built myself from scratch.

### WWDC Archives
[WWDC Archives](https://github.com/aalecaar/wwdc-archives) is an app that I built with the intention of showing information and insights on WWDC events since 2000. Although there are official resources to find this information, early events don't have the same visibility as newer events do, making it really hard to find information about them. In addition to that advantage, this app provides some interesting charts, allowing you to see how things have evolved since then. Finally, the information comes from a JSON source publicly available on [WWDC Index](https://nonstrict.eu/wwdcindex/). A big thank you to them for sharing this amazing resource! Please see the demos below to know all the app details.
